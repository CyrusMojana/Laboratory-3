# Laboratory-3

## Framework used:
Flask

## How to run the project:
1. Run the Virtual Machine with the required tools.
2. Run the cd WebApp and python3 app.py on the terminal of the VM.
3. The ip address should pop up and the web application can now be opened.

## Any issues encounterd and solution:
1. Connecting the multiple html from one another.
2. Another is the designing of the web application using css.
3. Debugging the code and trying to make it work.


## Reflection 
The challenges that I faced while doing the laboratory was the process of connecting the html to each other and debugging the code. Since the other was already given how to do It was not too hard. Another is the styling using css, it was a little bit hard to design a simple but looks good design. I learned the usage of tools like ufw which allows the traffic or manage the firewall of the server. Along with this is the understanding of the directory of each file since it wonâ€™t work if one of the files is not connected properly or called out properly. The framework that I find easiest to use was Flask, since it was the first one that I have tried, and it was already flexible enough for me which made the deployment of the web application easy. Finally, the deployment of the web application simulated real-world cloud hosting by being able to show that the web application can be opened using another browser outside the hosting machine. IP addresses were used to be able to open the web application from another browser. This laboratory was able to show how a simple web application can be used to showcase how cloud hosting works.
